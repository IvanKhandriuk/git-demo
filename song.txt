[Verse 1]
Like a lunatic, frantic
The man in the room looks so dramatic
With a left shoe on his right foot
This spiral traffic feels too traumatic, too traumatic
Quiet
The man is wandering around
Where's the way out he never found?
And inside
There's a ball made of lead
It's rolling and rumbling on parquet, yeah
Oh, how heavy is the ball
It bends his spine to the very ground
Neither his nor another
Enormous, ludicrous

[Chorus]
Oh, how heavy is his thought
In a half an hour or so
It crushed the floor
And smashed the man's toes

Oh, how heavy is his thought
In a half an hour or so
It crushed the floor
And smashed the man's soul
